# 🔐 Argon2id Migration Guide

## Overview

This project has been successfully migrated from **bcrypt** to **Argon2id** for password hashing, providing enhanced security for large-scale applications.

## Why Argon2id?

### Security Advantages

- **🛡️ Memory-hard algorithm**: Requires significant RAM, making GPU/ASIC attacks expensive
- **🏆 Industry standard**: Winner of the Password Hashing Competition (2015)
- **🔮 Future-proof**: Designed with modern threat models in mind
- **⚙️ Configurable**: Tunable memory, time, and parallelism parameters
- **🚀 Better resistance**: Superior protection against hardware-based attacks

### Current Configuration

```typescript
const ARGON2_CONFIG = {
  type: argon2.argon2id, // Hybrid version (recommended)
  memoryCost: 2 ** 16, // 64 MB memory usage
  timeCost: 3, // 3 iterations
  parallelism: 1, // Single thread
  hashLength: 32, // 32-byte output
  saltLength: 16, // 16-byte salt
};
```

## Files Modified

### Core Library

- `src/lib/password.ts` - New centralized password utility
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Updated NextAuth configuration

### API Routes

- `src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts` - New user registration
- `src/app/api/auth/signin/route.ts` - User authentication

### Migration Scripts

- `scripts/migrate-passwords.ts` - Handle existing bcrypt users

## Usage

### Hashing Passwords

```typescript
import { hashPassword } from "@/lib/password";

const hashedPassword = await hashPassword("userPassword123");
```

### Verifying Passwords

```typescript
import { verifyPassword } from "@/lib/password";

const isValid = await verifyPassword(storedHash, "userPassword123");
```

### Checking Hash Format

```typescript
import { isArgon2Hash } from "@/lib/password";

const isArgon2 = isArgon2Hash(passwordHash); // true for Argon2 hashes
```

## Migration Process

### For Existing Users

Since bcrypt hashes cannot be directly converted to Argon2id, existing users need to reset their passwords:

1. **Run the migration script**:

   ```bash
   npm run migrate:passwords
   ```

2. **The script will**:

   - Identify users with bcrypt hashes
   - Invalidate old passwords
   - List affected users for email notification

3. **Next steps**:
   - Implement password reset email functionality
   - Send reset emails to affected users
   - Users will set new passwords (automatically hashed with Argon2id)

### For New Users

All new user registrations automatically use Argon2id - no additional action required.

## Performance Metrics

- **Hashing time**: ~130-150ms (intentionally slow for security)
- **Memory usage**: 64MB per hash operation
- **Verification time**: ~130-150ms

> **Note**: The "slow" performance is intentional and crucial for security. It makes brute-force attacks computationally expensive.

## Security Features

### Configuration Details

- **Type**: Argon2id (hybrid of Argon2i and Argon2d)
- **Memory cost**: 64MB (2^16 KB)
- **Time cost**: 3 iterations
- **Parallelism**: 1 thread
- **Salt**: 16 bytes (automatically generated)
- **Output**: 32 bytes

### Security Benefits

1. **Resistance to side-channel attacks** (Argon2i component)
2. **Resistance to time-memory trade-offs** (Argon2d component)
3. **Configurable difficulty** that scales with hardware improvements
4. **Built-in salt generation** prevents rainbow table attacks
5. **Memory-hard design** makes specialized hardware attacks expensive

## Comparison: bcrypt vs Argon2id

| Feature         | bcrypt     | Argon2id      |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Memory usage    | Low (~4KB) | High (64MB)   |
| ASIC resistance | Moderate   | High          |
| GPU resistance  | Moderate   | High          |
| Configurability | Limited    | Extensive     |
| Standard        | Older      | Modern (2015) |
| Security level  | Good       | Excellent     |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Password verification failed"**

   - Ensure users have reset passwords after migration
   - Check if hash format is Argon2id using `isArgon2Hash()`

2. **Performance concerns**

   - Current configuration balances security and performance
   - Adjust `memoryCost` and `timeCost` if needed (lower = faster, less secure)

3. **Memory issues**
   - Monitor server memory usage during password operations
   - Consider adjusting `memoryCost` for resource-constrained environments

### Configuration Tuning

For different environments:

```typescript
// Development (faster, less secure)
const DEV_CONFIG = {
  memoryCost: 2 ** 12, // 4MB
  timeCost: 2,
  parallelism: 1,
};

// Production (current settings)
const PROD_CONFIG = {
  memoryCost: 2 ** 16, // 64MB
  timeCost: 3,
  parallelism: 1,
};

// High-security (slower, more secure)
const HIGH_SEC_CONFIG = {
  memoryCost: 2 ** 18, // 256MB
  timeCost: 5,
  parallelism: 2,
};
```
